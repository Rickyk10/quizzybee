## Note 1
Chebyshev time delay improvements investigated using a mapping function, compared against conventional matched line (CML) and differential CML (DCML) for both periodic (P) and general sequences.

## Note 2
Performance analysis (possibly random input-based) involving four distinct aspects: Chebyshev, CML, DCML, and sequence type (periodic/general).

## Note 3
Focus on mapping functions applied to Chebyshev time delay enhancements, contrasted with CML and its differential variant (DCML) in sequence processing.

## Note 4
Exploration of Chebyshev-based delay optimization within sequence processing, benchmarked against established CML and DCML techniques, considering periodic and general sequence inputs.

## Note 5
Comparative study of Chebyshev time delay optimization via mapping functions across various sequence types, evaluating performance relative to CML and DCML methodologies. Le Random analysis potentially indicates stochastic performance evaluation.
