## Note 1
Solar system comprises the Sun and orbiting bodies (planets, moons, asteroids, comets), with the Sun as the central energy source.

## Note 2
Eight planets categorized as terrestrial (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars – rocky, solid) or gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune – large, gaseous).

## Note 3
Earth, the third planet, uniquely supports life due to its atmosphere, liquid water, and moderate temperature.

## Note 4
Moons, varying in size and composition, orbit planets; some (e.g., Europa) may have subsurface oceans potentially harboring life.

## Note 5
Asteroids (rocky) primarily reside in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, while comets (icy) exhibit glowing tails near the Sun.

## Note 6
Solar system study illuminates the formation of planets, stars, and other celestial objects.

## Note 7
The Sun's energy is crucial for life on Earth, while the diversity of celestial bodies within the solar system provides insights into planetary and stellar evolution.
