## Note 1
Chebyshev time delay improved compared to existing methods.

## Note 2
Mapping functions investigated: Chebyshev, CML (presumably Convolutional Mapping Layer), and DCML (presumably Deep Convolutional Mapping Layer).

## Note 3
Comparison performed between Chebyshev and CML mapping for sequence processing.

## Note 4
Input sequences denoted as 'P sequences'. Output sequences also analyzed.

## Note 5
'Po' and 'L' mentioned, but context unclear.  Further investigation needed.

## Note 6
DCML explored as another mapping option for sequences.

## Note 7
Random performance analysis conducted (possibly as a baseline comparison).  'Le' likely a typo for 'The'.  Analysis involves 4 (unspecified units, possibly datasets or experiments).
