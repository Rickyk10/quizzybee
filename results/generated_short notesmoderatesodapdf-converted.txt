## Note 1
The solar system comprises the Sun and orbiting objects like planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The Sun is the central energy source.

## Note 2
Eight planets orbit the Sun: four terrestrial (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars – rocky with solid surfaces) and four gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune – large and gaseous).

## Note 3
Earth, the third planet from the Sun, uniquely supports life due to its atmosphere, liquid water, and moderate temperature.

## Note 4
Moons orbit many planets, varying in size and composition. Some, like Europa, may have subsurface oceans potentially harboring life.

## Note 5
Asteroids (rocky) are mainly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Comets (icy) develop glowing tails near the Sun.

## Note 6
Studying the solar system advances our understanding of the origins of planets, stars, and other celestial bodies.
