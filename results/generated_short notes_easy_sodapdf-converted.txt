## Note 1
The Solar System includes the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The Sun is the center and provides energy for life on Earth.

## Note 2
Eight planets orbit the Sun: four rocky terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) and four much larger gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).

## Note 3
Earth is special because it supports life thanks to its atmosphere, liquid water, and moderate temperature.

## Note 4
Moons orbit planets.  Earth has one, while Jupiter and Saturn have many. Some moons might even have oceans that could support life.

## Note 5
Asteroids are rocky objects mostly between Mars and Jupiter. Comets are icy objects with glowing tails when near the Sun. Studying the solar system helps us understand the universe.
